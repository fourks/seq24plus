FIRST BUILD, 20150615

$ ./configure 
failed.

tried:
$ autoreconf 

which suggested I rename 'configure.in' to 'configure.ac', which I did.

Then:
$ autoreconf 

said required file './compile' was missing, suggesting I try:
$ automake --add-missing
..which seemed reasonbly useful. It recommended I try

running
$ ./configure 
again said that 
    No package 'gtkmm-2.4' found

to fix: 
$ sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-2.4-dev


then did a 'make', but the bloody thing gave an error


did a big replace of all instances of 'SigC' with 'sigc' in the source files and it worked, but then found that I'd been working with verwion 0.8.7, when there's
a version of 0.9.2 available from: 

https://launchpad.net/seq24

this compiles first time!!
